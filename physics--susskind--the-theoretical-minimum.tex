\begin{enumerate}
\item Discrete state machines: simplest example of dynamical system
\item To be valid in classical mechanics, dynamical law must be:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Deterministic (There's only one next state)
  \item Reversible (Conservation of information: there's only one previous state)
  \end{enumerate}
\item Even in a cycle, there's still one in-edge and one out-edge
\item There can be separate cycles: these correspond to conservation laws
  (The system stays in the cycle it started in.)
\end{enumerate}

\item Difference between
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Discrete state machine
  \item Directed graph
  \item Discrete finite automaton
  \end{enumerate}
