Calculus is a technique for computing quantities related to functions by
treating the smooth curve or surface of function output values as being
comprised of many local linear functions. Each linear approximation applies
over a tiny (arbitrarily small) local interval; the linear approximation in the
next interval will in general have a slightly different gradient.

A central idea in calculus is the \textit{differential}: the change in output
value caused by a small change in the input value, at some starting input
value. This describes the way in which the function output changes in response
to changes in input. Differentials are often used to compute a
\textit{derivative}: the ratio of change in output value to the change in input
value. Derivatives define a local \textit{linear approximation} to the
function: over a small local region we consider the real function to be
approximated by a line with gradient equal to the derivative at that point.

\section*{Objects}

A function is a rule associating input values from one set with output values
from another; a function is a set of (input, output) pairs in which each input
value occurs at most once.

A curve in $d$ dimensions is a set of ``connected'' $d$-dimensional points.

Let $f$ be $\R \to \R$. The graph of $f$ is the set of points $(x,y)$
satisfying $y = f(x)$. This defines a curve in 2D (which never ``turns back on
itself''; the tangent line to the curve is never vertical.)

\subsection*{Parametric form}

Specifying a curve as the graph of a function (i.e. specifying one coordinate
as a function of the others) is one way to specify a curve, but it is limited
to functions, and even then it may not be convenient.

An alternative is parametric form: suppose the x-coordinate is given by $f(t)$
and the y-coordinate by $g(t)$. Then the curve is the set of points
$\big(f(t), g(t)\big)$ for some range of the parameter $t$.

\subsubsection*{Area under a curve}

What is the area $A$ under the curve from $t=a$ to $t=b$? It's just
$\int_\alpha^\beta y \dx$ as usual\footnote{$(\alpha, \beta) = (f(a), f(b))$},
but how do we express this as an integral with respect to $t$?

Well, $y = g(t)$; what about $\dx$? $x = f(t)$ (displacement), therefore
$\dx = \dt f'(t)$ (velocity $\times$ time; local linear approximation). So, the
area under the curve bounded by start and end $t$-values is
$A = \int_a^b g(t) f'(t) \dt$.

Thus, if the x-coordinate is increasing rapidly with $t$, then the area is
larger.

\subsubsection*{Length of a curve}

The length of a curve is $L = \int \sqrt{\dx^2 + \dy^2}$, over some interval.

This can be expressed as an integral with respect to $x$ (non-parametric form):
$L = \int_\alpha^\beta \sqrt{1 + (\frac{\dy}{\dx})^2} \dx$.

Or it can be expressed as an integral over an interval of $t$ values (parametric form):
$L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ (\frac{\dx}{\dt})^2 + (\frac{\dy}{\dt})^2} \dt$

\subsubsection*{Area of a surface formed by revolution of a curve}

Suppose a curve is revolved around the $x$-axis. To compute the area, we divide the surface into vertical strips: $A = \int_\alpha^\beta 2\pi y \sqrt{\dx^2 + \dy^2}$\footnote{I'm a bit confused. Why exactly do we construct these strips using the hypotenuse, whereas when approximating the area under a graph we construct rectangles $y\dx$?}.


\subsection*{Polar coordinates}


\subsubsection*{Area of a sector bounded by a curve}

What's the area of the sector bounded by the two rays and a curve, between $\theta=a$ and $\theta=b$?

Note that the area of a sector of $\phi$ radians of a circle is $\pi r^2 \times \frac{\phi}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{2}\phi r^2$.

We're considering a curve defined by $r = f(\theta)$. We divide it up into many
sectors each with angle $\d\theta$. The area is
$\int_a^b \frac{1}{2}f(\theta)^2\dtheta$.
