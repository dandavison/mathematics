\section{Equivalence relations and partitions}
An equivalence relation on a set $A$ is a subset of $A^2$. Thus for each pair
$(a_1, a_2) \in A^2$ the equivalence relation says whether they are or are
not related.

This doesn't tell you explicitly which group a pair belongs to. But the
information is there: the groups are the connected components in the graph in
which two vertices are connected if they are related.
