\section{Even and odd functions}

\begin{definition*}
  A function (over an additive group?) is even if and only if $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$.

  A function (over an additive group?) is odd if and only if $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$.
\end{definition*}

Functions can be neither even nor odd.

\begin{claim*}
  A polynomial $p(x)$ is even if an only if it has only even powers of $x$.

  A polynomial $p(x)$ is odd if an only if it has only odd powers of $x$.
\end{claim*}
