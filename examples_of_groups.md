### Examples of groups

### Finite order

- $S_2$: the set of permutations of two objects, where the operation is
  composition of functions.  There are just two elements in the group: the
  do-nothing permutation and the switch-the-elements permutation: $\{e,
  \tau\}$.

- $S_3$: the set of permutations of three objects. There are 6 elements: the
  identity, 3 transitions[ref]A transition is a permutation that switches two
  elements and leaves all other alone[/ref] and two cyclic permutations.

- $\{1, i, -1, -i\}$ where the operation is multiplication of complex numbers.

- $GL_n(\R)$: the set of $n \times n$ matrices, under matrix multiplication.

- $SL_n(\R)$: set of $n \times n$ matrices with determinant $1$ (kernel of the
  determinant homomorphism $GL_n(\R) \rightarrow \R^x$ and therefore a normal
  subgroup of $GL_n(\R)$)

### Infinite order

- $\Z^+$ integers under addition

- $\Z^x$ integers under multiplication

- $\Z_{>0}^+$ positive integers under addition

- Similarly, $\Q+$, $\Q^x$, $\C^+$, $\C^x$, $\R^+$, $\R^x$ etc
