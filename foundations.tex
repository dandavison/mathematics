\section{Set theory}

\begin{definition}[map, function]
  A \defn{map} (or \defn{function}) $f: A \to B$ is a subset of $A \times B$ such that each $a \in A$ has precisely one entry.

  $B^A$ is the set of maps $A \to B$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[disjoint union]
  The \defn{disjoint union} of a collection of sets $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ is
  \begin{align*}
    \bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_i := \bigcup_{i \in I} \{(x_i, i) ~:~ x_i \in A_i\}.
  \end{align*}
  Note that (I think) we think of $A_i$ as being a subset of the disjoint union; the sets ``remain distinct​'' in
  the union.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[product]
  To be fully precise, the \defn{product} $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$ is the set of maps from $I$ to the disjoint union over
  the $A_i$s:
  \begin{align*}
    \prod_{i \in I} A_i := \(\bigsqcup A_i\)^I
  \end{align*}

  In other words, each element of this product is a pair $(i, (x, i))$.

  But usually one just thinks of each element as a pair $(i, x)$, where $x \in A_i$. So alternatively one can
  say that each element of the product is a sequence $(x_i)_{i \in I}$:
  \begin{align*}
    \prod_{i \in I} A_i := \{(x_i)_{i \in I} ~:~ x_i \in A_i\}.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  So $\R^3$ is the set of all ``functions from a 3-point index set into $\R$​'' (Murfet). Or equivalently,
  $\R^3$ is the set of all real-valued sequences of length $3$.

  This avoids us worrying about whether $\R^3$ is $\R \times (\R \times \R)$ or $(\R \times \R) \times \R$; it is neither.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[power set]
The power set $\powerset(A)$ is the set of all subsets of $A$.

$\{0, 1\}^A$ means the set of all maps $A \to \{0, 1\}$. We have
\begin{align*}
  \powerset(A) \cong \{0, 1\}^A
\end{align*}
Each subset on the left has a corresponding characteristic function (indicator function) on the right.
\end{definition}


\section{Relations and partitions}
A relation on a set $A$ is a subset of $A^2$. Thus for a pair
$(a_1, a_2) \in A^2$ the relation says whether $a_1$ is related to $a_2$.

An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and
transitive, and thus makes sense as defining a partitioning of the set into
groups of equivalent elements.

The equivalence relation doesn't tell you explicitly which group a pair belongs
to (it just tells you that they are in the same group). But the information is
there: the groups are the connected components in the graph in which two
vertices are connected if they are related. There are fewer equivalence
relations than assignments to labeled buckets, since the equivalence relation
does not identify the buckets. \blue{How many equivalence relations are there,
compared to Stirling II number and stars-and-bars count configurations?}

\begin{definition}
  Let $R \subseteq A \times A$ be a binary relation (arbitrary set of pairs). The \defn{equivalence relation generated by}
  $R$ is the intersection of all equivalence relations on $A$ that include $R$. This is the smallest
  equivalence relation containing that set of pairs.
\end{definition}




\section{Permutations and combinations}

\begin{theorem*}
  The number of $k$-tuples that can be formed from $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ is
  \begin{align*}
    P(n, k) = n_{(k)} = n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}.
  \end{align*}
  The number of sets of size $k$ that can be formed from $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ is
  \begin{align*}
    C(n, k) = {n \choose k} = \frac{P(n, k)}{k!}.
  \end{align*}
\end{theorem*}

\section{Binomial theorem}
\begin{align*}
  (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n{n \choose k}a^{n-k}b^k
\end{align*}

\section{Taylor expansions}

Suppose that any function of a real number $f(x)$ can be represented by a "power series" with certain coefficients $c_i$
\begin{align*}
  f(x) = c_0 + c_1x^1 + c_2x^2 + c_3x^3 + c_4x^4 + ...
\end{align*}
Examining successive derivatives shows that $c_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}$ (\red{TODO} explain why evaluating at zero).
For example, the Maclaurin expansion of $e^{x}$ is
\begin{align*}
  e^x = e^{0} + \frac{xe^0}{1!} + \frac{x^2e^0}{2!} + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}
\end{align*}

\section{Triangle inequalities}

\begin{theorem*}
  Let $a, b \in \R$ with $a \neq b$ and $a, b \neq 0$. Using $+$, $-$ and $|\cdot|$ we can generate the
  following 4 real numbers:
  \begin{align*}
    -\big(|a| + |b|\big) ~~~ < ~~~
    -\big||a| - |b|\big| ~~~ < ~~~
    0                    ~~~ < ~~~
    \big||a| - |b|\big|  ~~~ < ~~~
    |a| + |b|.
  \end{align*}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $a + b$ and $a - b$ can equal any of them.
  \item $|a + b|$ and $|a - b|$ can equal either of the two positive numbers.
  \item $|a| - |b|$ can equal either of the two ``inner'' numbers.
  \end{itemize}
  ~\\~\\
  If we allow $a = b$ with $ a \neq 0, b \neq 0$ then
  \begin{align*}
    -\big(|a| + |b|\big) ~~~ < ~~~
    -\big||a| - |b|\big| ~~~ \red{\leq} ~~~
    0                    ~~~ \red{\leq} ~~~
    \big||a| - |b|\big|  ~~~ < ~~~
    |a| + |b|.
  \end{align*}
  If we allow $a = 0$ and $b = 0$ with $a \neq b$ then
  \begin{align*}
    -\big(|a| + |b|\big) ~~~ \red{\leq} ~~~
    -\big||a| - |b|\big| ~~~ < ~~~
    0                    ~~~ < ~~~
    \big||a| - |b|\big|  ~~~ \red{\leq} ~~~
    |a| + |b|;
  \end{align*}
  If we allow $a = b$ including $a = b = 0$ then
  \begin{align*}
    -\big(|a| + |b|\big) ~~~ \red{\leq} ~~~
    -\big||a| - |b|\big| ~~~ \red{\leq} ~~~
    0                    ~~~ \red{\leq} ~~~
    \big||a| - |b|\big|  ~~~ \red{\leq} ~~~
    |a| + |b|;
  \end{align*}
\end{theorem*}

\section{The quadratic formula}

\begin{theorem*}
  The roots of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
\end{theorem*}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{align*}
    x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a}                        &= 0\\
    \(x + \frac{b}{2a}\)^2 - \frac{b^2}{4a^2} + \frac{c}{a} &= 0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\text{``completing the square"}\\
    x &= -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{4ac}{4a^2}}\\
                                                            &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\section{Geometric series}
\begin{theorem*}
  $a_n := \sum_{k=0}^nr^k = \frac{~~~~1 - r^{n+1}}{1 - r}$.

  Therefore if $r < 1$ then $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \frac{1}{1 - r}$.
\end{theorem*}
\begin{proof}
  \begin{align*}
    a_n          &= \sum_{k=0}^nr^n = 1 + r + r^2 + \ldots + r^n\\
    a_n - ra_n  &= 1 - r^{n+1}\\
    a_n          &= \frac{~~~~1 - r^{n+1}}{1 - r}
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
\begin{remark*}
  Note that $a_{n+1} = 1 + ra_n$.
\end{remark*}

\section{Partial fractions}

\red{TODO}

\section{Even and odd functions}

\begin{definition*}
  A function (over an additive group?) is even if $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$.

  A function (over an additive group?) is odd if $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$.
\end{definition*}

Functions can be neither even nor odd.

\begin{claim*}
  A polynomial $p(x)$ is even if an only if it has only even powers of $x$.

  A polynomial $p(x)$ is odd if an only if it has only odd powers of $x$.
\end{claim*}

\section{Convex and concave functions}\label{convexity}
A real-valued function $f:\R\to\R$ is \defn{convex} over an interval $[x_1, x_2]$ if the line
segment joining $f(x_1)$ to $f(x_2)$ lies above the graph of $f$, i.e. if
\begin{align*}
  pf(x_1) + (1-p)f(x_2) \geq f(px_1 + (1 - p)x_2).
\end{align*}
E.g. $x \mapsto x^2$ and $x \mapsto e^x$ are convex.

A real-valued function $f$ is \defn{concave} if $-f$ is convex. These definitions extend to
real-valued functions $f$ over an $n$-dimensional interval / convex set\footnote{ Basically, a set
  which includes all points on line segments joining points in the set.}.

\section{Trigonometric identities}
\begin{align*}
  \cos 2\theta &= \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta
\end{align*}

\section{Hyperbolic trigonometric functions}\label{foundations-hyperbolic-trig-functions}

Define
\begin{align*}
  \cosh x &= \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} \\
  \sinh x &= \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}.
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
  \ddx \cosh x &= \sinh x \\
  \ddx \sinh x &= \cosh x,
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
  \cosh^2 x             &= \frac{1}{4}\(e^{2x} + e^{-2x}\) + \frac{1}{2} \\
  \sinh^2 x             &= \frac{1}{4}\(e^{2x} + e^{-2x}\) - \frac{1}{2} \\
  1 + \sinh^2 x         &= \cosh^2 x \\
  \sinh^2 x + \cosh^2 x &= \cosh 2x
\end{align*}

$\sin$ and $\sinh$ are odd, and $\cos$ and $\cosh$ are even.

Note that these functions equal their own second derivatives. I.e. they provide solutions to
\begin{align*}
  \ddot{x} - x = 0.
\end{align*}
In contrast, $\sin$ and $\cos$ equal the negative of their own second derivative, so they provide
solutions to
\begin{align*}
  \ddot{x} + x = 0.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{\url{https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/61siyw/eli5_can_someone_explain_the_hyperbolic_trig/}}

They are a bit mysterious, but not at all scary. It is just a way of grouping the exponential
functions into even and odd components.

From calculus, you know the relationship between the exponential and the standard trig functions:

\begin{align*}
e^{ix} = cos x + i sin x
\end{align*}

That works for imaginary arguments to the exponential and it splits it into a real and even
component (cosine) and an imaginary and odd component (sine). That is the solution to this
differential equation

\begin{align*}
  \ddot{y} + y = 0.
\end{align*}

Those functions are equal to the opposite sign of the second
derivative.

What about this differential equation:

\begin{align*}
  \ddot{y} - y = 0
\end{align*}

where the function is equal to its second derivative? Those solutions are simply $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$
. But neither of those solutions are even or odd. You could re-group those two solutions so that you
have an even solution and an odd solution.

\begin{align*}
e^x + e^{-x} &= (1/2) (e^x + e^{-x} ) + (1/2) (e^x - e^{-x} )
\end{align*}
They define the even solution to be hyperbolic cosine and the odd solution to be hyperbolic sine.

\begin{align*}
e^x + e^{-x} &= cosh x + sinh x
\end{align*}
So the definitions of the regular and hyperbolic trig functions with relation to the exponentials
are:

\begin{align*}
cos x &= (1/2) ( e^{ix} + e^{-ix} ) \\
sin x &= (1/2i) ( e^{ix} - e^{-ix} )
\end{align*}
and

\begin{align*}
cosh x &= (1/2) ( e^x + e^{-x} ) \\
sinh x &= (1/2) ( e^x - e^{-x} )
\end{align*}

You can see the analogy! From there, they can work out more algebra and calculus to see if there's
any other useful relations that make this splitting of the expontial into even and odd components
helpful. But it is not as crucial that you work with the hyperbolic functions this way. You could
choose to leave the solutions in their $e^{x}$ and $e^{-x}$ . Many times it helps, but its use is
not as common as the standard trig functions.


\begin{definition*}

 $c | a$, i.e. $c$ is a \defn{divisor} of $a$ (and $a$ is a \defn{multiple} of $c$), if there exists $d$ such that $cd = a$.

 $\gcd(a, b)$, the \defn{greatest common denominator} of $a$ and $b$, is the largest integer $c$ such that $c | a$ and $c | b$.

  $a$ and $b$ are \defn{relatively prime} aka \defn{coprime} if $\gcd(a, b) = 1$.

  $\lcm(c, d)$ is the smallest integer $a$ such that $c|a$ and $d|a$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{remark*}
  The $\gcd$ is the largest integer whose factorization is a ``subset​'' of both factorizations.

  The $\lcm$ is the smallest integer whos factorization is a ``superset​'' of both factorizations.

  For example if
  \begin{align*}
    a = 12 &= 2^2 \cdot 3 \\
    b = 40 &= 2^3 \cdot 5 \\
  \end{align*}
  then $\gcd(a, b) = 2^2 = 4$ and $\lcm(a, b) = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 120$.

\end{remark*}


\section{$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational}
\begin{theorem*}
  $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
\end{theorem*}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\sqrt{2} \in \Q$. Then $\sqrt{2}$ can be written as $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b \in \Z$ are relatively prime.

  Then $2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$, so $a^2$ is even.

  Therefore $a$ is even.

  Let $a = 2c$. Then $b^2 = \frac{4c^2}{2} = 2c^2$, so $b^2$ is even.

  Therefeore both $a$ and $b$ are even, which is a contradiction.

  Therefore $\sqrt{2} \notin \Q$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark*}
  It remains to be proved that $\sqrt{2}$ exists in $\R$. See \ref{existence-of-root-2}.
\end{remark*}

\begin{claim*}
  The sum of the first $n$ odd numbers equals $n^2$.
\end{claim*}

The claim is that $ = n^2$.

Note that by drawing patterns of dots we see that $\sum_{i=1}^n i$ can always be arranged to form
the upper triangle of a square, including the diagonal. Therefore
$\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n^2 - n}{2} + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, and

\begin{align*}
  \sum_{i=1}^n (2i - 1)
  &= 2\sum_{i=1}^n i - n \\
  &= 2\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - n \\
  &= n^2.
\end{align*}
