\section*{The problem}
There are $m$ members of a club. Member $i$ has $f_i$ friends who are not yet in the club. There
are two relevant actions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A member may {\it message} a friend to suggest joining the club.
\item Once messaged, the friend may {\it accept} the suggestion (join the club).
\end{enumerate}
The problem is to maximize the number of club members by suggesting friends to
message. Specifically, for each member we suggest $r$ of their friends for them to message.

\section*{Training data}

The training data contains a total of $n$ friends of $m$ members, i.e. $n = \sum_{i=1}^m f_i$.

For each friend we have $d$ features, so the training data $X$ is an $n \times d$ table.

There are two $y$ columns:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $y_1$ is $\true$ if friend $i$ was {\it messaged} by their associated member, else $\false$.
\item $y_2$ is $\true$ if friend $i$ was {\it messaged} by their associated member {\it and
    accepted}, else $\false$.
\end{enumerate}
