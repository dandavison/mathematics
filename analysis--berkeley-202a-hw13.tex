\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{claim*}
    $A \union B$ is connected.
  \end{claim*}

  \begin{proof}
    We must show that $A \union B$ cannot be written as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets.

    Suppose for a contradiction that $U$ and $V$ are disjoint open sets such that $U \union V = A \cup B$.
    Let $z \in B$ and without loss of generality suppose that $z \in V$. Then $B \subseteq V$ (since $B$ is
    connected). Note that the open ball at $(0, 0)$ contains a point of $B$. But $U$ and $V$ are disjoint,
    therefore $(0, 0) \in V$. But $(0, 0) \in A$ and $A$ is connected, so $A \subseteq V$.
    Therefore $A \union B = V$. But this is a contradiction since $U$ and $V$ are disjoint and non-empty.
    Therefore $A \union B$ are connected.
  \end{proof}


  \begin{claim*}
    $A \union B$ is not path-connected.
  \end{claim*}

  \begin{proof}
    Suppose for a contradiction that there exists a continuous function $f: [0, 1] \to A \union B$ such
    that $f(0) = (0, 0)$ and $f(1) = (0, 1)$.

    Suppose for a contradiction that there exists a continuous function $f: [0, 1] \to A \union B$ such
    that $f(0) = (0, 1)$ and $f(1) = (0, 0)$.

    Write $f = (f_x, f_y)$ where $f_x: [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$ and $f_y: [0, 1] \to [-1, 1]$ give the coordinates of $f$.

    Let $\eps > 0$ and let $(t_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be an increasing sequence with $0 < t_n < 1$ and $t_n \to 1$.
    Then $f_y(t_n) \to 0$ since $f$ is continuous. Let $N$ be such that $f_y(t_n) < \eps$ for all $n \geq N$. But
    this is a contradiction since $f_y (t_n))$ is oscillating between $-1$ and $1$ but $\eps$ is arbitrary.
    Therefore no such continuous function $f$ exists.
  \end{proof}

  Informally, we will take vertical intervals positioned at each point of a countably infinite sequence of
  rationals and between each successive pair, place a variant of the ``topologist's sine curve​'' constructed so
  that it ``speeds up​'' in both directions. The resulting topological space will be connected but not
  path-connected, because we have seen above that that is what happens when the topologist's sine curve
  approaches a vertical interval.

  Let $\N$ be the natural numers excluding $0$.

  Let $q_n = \sum_{i=1}^n 2^{-n} \in \Q \cap [\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. Then $\{q_n ~:~ n \in \N\}$ is a countably
  infinite set of rationals in $[\frac{1}{2}, 1)$.

  Let $I_n = \{q_n\} \times [0, 1] \subset U$. This is a vertical interval of unit length.

  Let $m_n = (q_{n+1} - q_n)/2$ and let $S_n = \{\sin\((|x - m_n| - m_n)^{-1}\) ~:~ x \in (q_n, q_{n+1})\}$. We
  will refer to this as a ``bidirectional topologist's sine curve​''.

  Finally, let $U = \{I_n ~:~ n \in \N\} \union \{S_n ~:~ n \in \N\}$.

  Informally, $U$ consists of a countable collection of vertical intervals together with a ``bidirectional
  topologist's sine curve​'' between each successive pair of vertical intervals.


  \begin{claim}
    $U$ is a bounded and connected subset of $\R^2$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}
    $U \subset [0, 1]^2 \subset \R^2$ therefore $U$ is a bounded subset of $\R^2$.

    Recall that we proved above that $V := \(\{0\} \times [0, 1]\) \union \{\sin(1/x) ~:~ x \in (0, 1]\}$ is a
    connected topological space.

    It follows that $I_n \union S_n$ is connected for all $n$ (formally, I believe we can prove this by
    exhibiting a homeomorphism between $V$ and $I_n \union S_n$ and noting that a topological space is
    connected if it is homeomorphic to a different connected topological space. Or possibly I would have to use
    just the ``first half​'' of $S_n$, i.e. $I_n \cup \(S_n \cap \((q_n, m_n) \times [0, 1]\)\)$)

    Similarly, it follows that $S_n \cup I_{n+1}$ is connected for all $n$ (the geometry is identical but with
    left-right orientation reversed).

    It then follows by induction that $U$ is connected.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{claim}
    $U$ has infinitely many path-connected components and infinitely many of these take the form of a vertical
    interval of unit length.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}
    Let $I_n = \{q_n\} \times [0, 1] \subset U$. This is a vertical interval of unit length. Clearly, $I_n$ is
    path-connected. To see this, let $(q_n, y_1), (q_n, y_2) \in I_n$ and without loss of generality suppose
    that $y_1 < y_2$. - Then $f: [0, 1] \to I_n$ defined by $f(t) = (q_n, y_1 + t(y_2 - y_1))$ has the property
    that $f(0) = (q_n, y_1)$ and $f(1) = (q_n, y_2)$.

    Recall that $S_n$ is a ``bidirectional topologist's sine curve​'' in the current construction, and recall also
    that we proved above that $\(\{0\} \times [0, 1]\) \union \{\sin(1/x) ~:~ x \in (0, 1]\}$ is not path
    connected. It follows that neither $I_n \union S_n$ nor $I_n \union S_{n-1}$ is path-connected, and it
    follows from this that $I_n \union I_{m}$ is not path-connected for all $n \neq m$. We
    have $\bigcup_{n \in \N} I_n \subset U$, therefore $U$ contains infinitely many path-connected components
    which take the form of a vertical interval of unit length.
  \end{proof}

\begin{proof}
  This is theorem 20.30 of Bass; the proof is given there. The theorem states that if $X$ is compact Hausdorff
  then $X$ is normal, and the conditions asked for here are part of the definition of normal.\\

Note that $H$ offers a continuous deformation of the loop $f$ into the loop $g$, in the sense that each
function $y \to H(0, y)$, for $y$

Note that $H$ offers a continuous deformation of the loop $f$ into the loop $g$, in the sense that each
function $y \mapsto H(x, y)$, for $y \in [0, 1]$, is a loop. For $x = 0$ this is the loop $f$, and as $x$ rises
from $0$ to $1$, the loop continuously deforms from $f$ into $g$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item
  \begin{claim*}
    The relation $f$ is deformable into $g$ is an equivalence relation on the collection of loops in $X$.
  \end{claim*}

  \begin{proof}
    Let $\sim$ be the relation: $f$ is deformable into $g$.
    \begin{enumerate}

    \item {\it Reflexive}: yes, $f \sim f$ since we may take $H(x, y) = f(y)$ for all $x$.

    \item {\it Symmetric}: Let $H_{f,g}: [0, 1]^2 \to X$ be a function such that $f \sim g$.
      Then $H_{g,f} = \{((1 - x, y), H(x, y)) ~:~ x \in [0, 1], y \in [0, 1]\}$ is a function such
      that $g \sim f$.

    \item {\it Transitive}: Let $H_{f,g}: [0, 1]^2 \to X$ be such that $f \sim g$, and let
      $H_{g,h}: [0, 1]^2 \to X$ be such that $g \sim h$. Then
      \begin{align*}
        H_{f, h} =
        ~~~~&\{ (x, y, H_{f, g}) ~:~ x \in [0, 0.5), y \in [0, 1]\} \\
        ~~~~\union ~&\{ (x, y, H_{g, h}) ~:~ x \in [0.5, 1], y \in [0, 1]\}
      \end{align*}
      is a function such that $f \sim h$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof}

\item
  \begin{claim*}
    There are uncountably many equivalence classes for the collection of loops in $A$.
  \end{claim*}


  Informally: each loop corresponds to a countable sequence of circles each of which may be followed in one of
  two orientations (clockwise and anticlockwise). Loop $f$ is deformable into loop $g$ if their sequence of
  circles are the same and their sequence of orientations are the same. The number of circles involved in a
  single loop is countably infinite (though possibly finite), therefore the set of oriented loops has
  cardinality equal to the powerset of the natural numbers, and this is also the cardinality of the set of
  equivalence classes.

  \begin{proof}
    We define a loop in $A$ to be a continuous function $f: [0, 1] \to \R^2$ satisfying $f(0) = f(1) = (0, 0)$
    and $f([0, 1]) \subseteq A$.

    Let $\mc L = \{f_\gamma ~:~ \gamma \in \Gamma\}$ be the collection of loops in $A$.

    Let $K_\gamma = \big|\{t \in [0, 1) ~:~ f_\gamma(t) = (0, 0) \}\big|$ be the number of times
    loop $f_\gamma$ passes through $(0, 0)$ before $t = 1$, if this is finite. If the loop follows infinitely
    many circles then set $K_\gamma = \infty$. We have $K_\gamma \geq 1$ because each loop starts
    at $(0, 0)$.

    Note that a circle may be followed in one of two ``orientations​'': clockwise or anticlockwise.
    Let $\rho_{\gamma, k}$ be the orientation of the $k$-th circle in loop $\gamma$.

    If $K_\gamma < \infty$ then set $\rho_{\gamma, k} = 0$ for all $k > K_\gamma$. Thus every loop $f_\gamma$
    is associated with an infinite sequence $\rho_1, \rho_2, \ldots$.

    Define the relation $f \sim g$ to mean $f$ is deformable into $g$. We have seen above that this is an
    equivalence relation.

    Let $\lambda, \gamma \in \Gamma$. We claim that $f_\gamma \sim f_\lambda$ if and only
    if $\rho_{\gamma, k} = \rho_{\lambda, k}$ for all $k \in \N$. In other words, two loops are equivalent if
    and only if the sequences of orientations of their circles are the same.

    \red{TODO}: make this topological argument.

    (Careful: there are finite loops (for which we have assigned an infinite tail of zeros), and also infinite
    loops which happen to have a tail of zeros.)

    Therefore the set of equivalence classes under $\sim$ is in bijection with the set of infinite binary
    sequences $\{(\rho_1, \rho_2, \ldots) ~:~ \rho_k \in \{0, 1\}\}$. Clearly, this is uncountable, since it is
    in bijection with the uncountable set $[0, 1] \subset \R$. Explicitly, let $\omega \in [0, 1]$ and
    let $d_1, d_2, \ldots$ be the binary expansion of the fractional part of $\omega$. If this expansion
    terminates after finitely many, say $J$, places, then set $d_j = 0$ for all $j > J$. Then we
    assign $\omega \mapsto (d_j)_{j=1}^\infty$. This is clearly injective, and also surjective since every
    possible binary expansion is realised by some $\omega \in [0, 1]$.
  \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
