\section{Fibonacci - formula}

Let $V$ be the vector space containing all sequences of real numbers
$u_1, u_2, \ldots$.

Let $W$ be the subspace of $V$ containing sequences such that
$u_{n+2} = u_{n+1} + u_n$ for all $n$.

(This is a subspace since it contains the zero sequence, and it is closed under
forming linear combinations of sequences, as these maintain the fibonacci
additive property.)

Consider the two elements:
\begin{align*}
  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \ldots\\
  1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \ldots
\end{align*}

What's the dimension of this subspace?
