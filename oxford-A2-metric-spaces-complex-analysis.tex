\begin{remark*}
  $d$ is the Hamming distance.
\end{remark*}

For $d$ to be a metric on $X$ we require
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{$d$ is a function $d:X \times X \to $ (a set of non-negative numbers).}\\
  Yes, this is true.
\item \textbf{Positivity}:\\
  Yes, cardinality is never negative and it is clear that $d(a,b) = 0 \iff a = b$.
\item \textbf{Symmetry}:\\
  Yes, follows from the fact that $a_i \neq b_i \iff b_i \neq a_i$.
\item \textbf{Triangle inequality}:\\
  % Want: $d(a, b) \leq d(a, c) + d(c, b)$ for all $a, b, c \in X$.
  Note that $d(a, b) = \sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_{a_i,b_i}$, where $\epsilon_{ij} :=
  \begin{cases}
    0, ~~~ i = j\\
    1, ~~~ i \neq j
  \end{cases}
$ (the ``negation'' of the Kronecker delta).

  Fix $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$. Suppose that $\epsilon_{a_i,b_i} = 0$. Then
  $\epsilon_{a_i,b_i} \leq \epsilon_{a_i,c_i} + \epsilon_{c_i,b_i}$. Alternatively suppose that
  $\epsilon_{a_i,b_i} = 1$. Then we have either $\epsilon_{a_i,c_i} = 0$, in which case
  $\epsilon_{c_i,b_i} = \epsilon_{a_i,b_i} = 1$, or we have $\epsilon_{a_i,c_i} = 1$.

  Therefore $\epsilon_{a_i,b_i} \leq \epsilon_{a_i,c_i} + \epsilon_{c_i,b_i}$, and therefore
  $\sumin \epsilon_{a_i,b_i} \leq \sumin \epsilon_{a_i,c_i} + \sumin \epsilon_{c_i,b_i}$, as required.
\end{enumerate}

Recall that $d_1:\R^n\times\R^n\to\R_{\geq 0}$ is given by $d_1(a, b) := \sum_{i=1}^n|a_i - b_i|$.

Let $\Omega = \{0, 1\} \subseteq \R$ and let $a, b \in \Omega^n \subseteq \R^n$.

Note that $|a_i - b_i| = \epsilon_{a_ib_i}$.

Therefore $d_1(a, b) = \sum_{i=1}^n\epsilon_{a_ib_i} = d(a, b)$, as required.

\begin{claim*}
  $A \cup B$ is bounded and $\diam(A \cup B) \leq \diam(A) + \diam(B)$.
\end{claim*}

\begin{proof}
  Let $c_1, c_2 \in A \cup B$.

  Note that $c_1, c_2 \in A \implies d(c_1, c_2) \leq \diam(A)$ and
  $c_1, c_2 \in B \implies d(c_1, c_2) \leq \diam(B)$.

  Suppose, without loss of generality, that $c_1 \in A$ and $c_2 \in B$. Let $c_3 \in A \cap
  B$. Then by the triangle inequality we have
  $d(c_1, c_2) \leq d(c_1, c_3) + d(c_3, c_2) \leq \diam(A) + \diam(B)$.

  Therefore $A \cup B$ is bounded and $\diam(A \cup B) \leq \diam(A) + \diam(B)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{claim*}
  If $A \subseteq B$ then $\diam(A) \leq \diam(B)$.
\end{claim*}

\begin{proof}
  Let $A \subseteq B$, and suppose for a contradiction that $\diam(A) > \diam(B)$. Then there exist
  $a_1, a_2 \in A$ such that $d(a_1, a_2) > \diam(B)$. But since $A \subseteq B$ we have
  $a_1, a_2 \in B$. This contradicts the definition of $\diam(B)$ as the supremum over distances
  between pairs of elements of $B$. Therefore $\diam(A) \leq \diam(B)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma*}
  Let $f:V \to W$ be a linear map between normed vector spaces. Then $f$ is continuous if and only
  if $\{\norm{f(x)} : \norm{x} \leq 1\}$ is bounded.
\end{lemma*}

\begin{proof}
  See $\epsilon-\delta$ argument in lecture notes.
\end{proof}

% \begin{claim*}
%   The Euclidean norm is independent of basis.
% \end{claim*}

% \begin{proof}~\\
%   Let $B$ and $B'$ be bases of $\R^n$ and let $P$ be a matrix with the elements of $B'$ as its
%   columns.

%   I.e. if $v$ contains the coordinates of a vector with respect to basis $B$, Then $Pv$...

%   With respect to $B$, we have $\norm{v} = \sqrt{\sumin v_i^2}$.

%   With respect to $B'$, we have $\norm{v} = \sqrt{\sumin (Pv_i)^2}$.
% \end{proof}

\begin{claim*}
  $\{\norm{f(x)} : \norm{x} \leq 1\}$ is bounded. \Intuition{the image of the unit sphere is
    bounded in norm}
\end{claim*}

\begin{proof}
Note that $\norm{f(x)}^2 := \sum_{i=1}^n f(x)_i^2$, where $f(x)_i$ is the $i$-th coordinate of
$f(x)$ with respect to the standard basis.

Therefore it is sufficient to show that $\{|f(x)_i| : \norm{x} \leq 1\}$ is bounded for all
$1 \leq i \leq n$.

Let $a_i$ be the $i$-th row of the $n \times n$ matrix of $f$.

Then $|f(x)_i| = |\langle a_i, x \rangle| \leq \norm{a_i}\norm{x}$.
\end{proof}

% \begin{intuition*}
%   The proof of the (linear, continuous) $\iff$ (linear, image bounded in norm) lemma uses
%   $\epsilon-\delta$ arguments. Then we use Cauchy-Schwarz to show that the image of the unit sphere
%   is bounded in norm as prescribed.
% \end{intuition*}

\begin{proof}~\\
  Let $B(x, r)$ be an open ball of radius $r$ centered at $x$.

  Note that for every $\delta > 0$ there exists $N \in \N$ such that $d(x_n, \ell) < \delta$ for all
  $n > N$.

  Let $y \neq \ell$ and let $N = \min\{n ~|~ d(x_n, \ell) < d(y, \ell)\}$.

  Let $M = \argmin_{n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}} D(n)$, where $D:\N \to \R$ is defined by
  $D(n) :=
  \begin{cases}
    d(x_n, y), &x_n \neq y\\
    \infty, &x_n = y
  \end{cases}$.

  Informally, $x_M$ is the element of $S$ that is closest but not equal to $y$.

  Note that $\Big(B(\ell, \frac{x_M - y}{2})\setminus\{\ell\}\Big) \cap S = \emptyset$.

  Therefore $y \neq \ell \implies y \notin S'$, or equivalently, $S' \seq \{\ell\}$.

  Now suppose that $S$ is such that there exists $N \in \N$ such that $x_n = \ell$ for all $n > N$.

  Let $M = \max\{n ~|~ x_n \neq \ell\}$.

  Note that $\Big(B(\ell, \frac{x_M - \ell}{2})\setminus\{\ell\}\Big) \cap S = \emptyset$.

  Therefore it is possible that $\ell \notin S'$, or equivalently, $S' = \emptyset$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma*}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be metric spaces. $h:X \to Y$ is continuous iff for every open set $U \in Y$, the
  preimage $h^\1(U)$ is an open set in $X$.
\end{lemma*}

\begin{claim*}
  $(g \circ f):R \to T$ is continuous.
\end{claim*}

\begin{proof}
Let $U_T$ be an open set of $T$.

Note that $(g \circ f)^\1(t) = f^\1(g^\1(t))$.

By the lemma, since $f$ and $g$ are continuous, $f^\1(g^\1(U_T))$ is an open set in $R$.
\end{proof}

Where does it fail?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Positivity?
\item Symmetry?
\item Triangle inequality?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{mdframed}

\begin{definition*}
  A subset $X \seq M$ is open if at every point $x \in X$ there exists a $\delta$ such that
  $B(x, \delta) \seq X$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{proof}~\\
  If $M$ is empty it is vacuously true, so suppose $M$ is not empty.

  $M$ itself is open since there are no points outside $M$, so any ball centred on a point of $M$
  must be a subset of $M$.

  Suppose that $X \subset (M, d)$ is not open.

  Then there exists $x \in X$ with the following property: there does not exist $\delta > 0$ such
  that $B(x, \delta) \seq X$.

  However, $M$ is finite. Therefore we may pick the element of $M$ that is closest to $x$, and set
  $\delta$ to be half this distance.

  This contradiction shows that no such non-open $X$ exists.
\end{proof}
