Newton's law of gravity: the force between two bodies is $F = G\frac{Mm}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the
gravitational constant.

Units: since $[F] = \frac{LM}{T^2}$, we have $[G] = \frac{LM}{T^2}\frac{L^2}{M^2} = \frac{L^3}{MT^2}$.

\begin{tabular*}{1.0\linewidth}{l|l}
  $M_E = 5.972 \times 10^{24} kg$ & mass of the Earth \\
  $R =  6.371 \times 10^6 m$     & radius of the Earth \\
  $G = 6.67408 \times 10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$        & gravitational constant\\
  $m$ & mass of an object
\end{tabular*}

The acceleration of the object due to gravity at the Earth's surface is
\begin{align*}
  g
  = \frac{F}{m}
  = G\frac{M_E}{R^2}
  = \frac{6.67408 \times 10^{-11} \times 5.972 \times 10^{24}}{(6.371 \times 10^6)^2}
  = 9.82 ms^{-2}.
\end{align*}


\section{Potential energy, conservative force, and work}

The \defn{work} done when a particle moves from $x_0$ to $x_1$ is defined to be
\begin{align*}
  W(x_0 \to x_1) := \int_{x_0}^{x_1} F(x) \dx.
\end{align*}

If this is independent of the path taken between $x_0$ and $x_1$, then we say the force is
\defn{conservative} and define the \defn{potential energy} at $x$, relative to $x_0$ to be
\begin{align*}
  V(x) &:= -\int_{x_0}^x F(x') \dx'.
\end{align*}
If the integral depends on the path taken, the potential energy is undefined.

\blue{A force moves something in space (causes an acceleration). Equivalently, something moves in
  space because a small displacement in some direction is associated with a lower potential
  energy. In fact, the force at a location \emph{is} the gradient in potential energy at that
  location.}

\begin{align*}
  F(x) &= -\frac{\d V(x)}{\dx} \\
  V(x) &= -\int_{x_0}^x F(x') \dx'
\end{align*}

\todo{Understand this}:

A force that depends only on position in one dimension is always conservative, because the integral
depends only on the endpoints. But a force that depends on e.g. time or velocity is
non-conservative. Friction is such a force because although it looks like a constant force
($\mu mg$), its direction (sign) is the opposite of the direction of velocity, so it is in fact
velocity-dependent.

Also, how is this so:
\begin{quote}
  \emph{Since friction always opposes the motion, the contributions to the $W = \int F \dx$ integral are
    always negative, so there is never any cancellation. The result is therefore a large negative
    number.}
\end{quote}
\subsection{Example: gravitational potential energy}

Consider two point masses $M$ and $m$, separated by a distance $r$. Newton's law of gravitation
states that there is a force between them of magnitude $-GMm/r^2$ (the force is attractive, hence
the negative sign).

The potential energy of the system at separation $r$, relative to separation $r_0$, is

\begin{align*}
  V(r) &= -\int_{r_0}^r F(r) \dr \\
       &= -\int_{r_0}^r \frac{-GMm}{r^2} \dr \\
       &= -\(\frac{GMm}{r} - \frac{GMm}{r_0}\).
\end{align*}

Typically in this situation we would choose $r_0 = \infty$ as the reference separation, so that
\begin{align*}
  V(r) = -\frac{GMm}{r}.
\end{align*}

\blue{Potential energy, relative to $r = \infty$, decreases as the two masses get closer: so the
  masses will approach each other. It's always negative because we have measured it relative to
  $r = \infty$, and any separation is more favorable than infinitely large separation.}

\begin{question*}
  What is the gravitational potential energy of a mass $m$ at a height $y$, relative to the Earth's
  surface?
\end{question*}

\begin{proof}
  Let the mass and radius of Earth be $M$ and $R$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    V(y) &= -\(\frac{GMm}{R + y} - \frac{GMm}{R}\) \\
         &= GMm(\frac{R + y - R}{R^2 + Ry}) \\
   &\approx \frac{GMmy}{R^2},
  \end{align*}
  for $y << R$. Recall that the gravitational acceleration of a particle of mass $m$ is $g = \frac{GM}{R^2}$. So
  we can write this in terms of $g$ as
  \begin{align*}
  V(y) &\approx mgy.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
\blue{This expression for potential energy decreases as the height $y$ decreases. It does still
  depend on the inverse of the spatial separation, but this factor is approximately constant since
  $y << R$. In any case, the mass falls to Earth, since smaller $y$ has lower potential energy. The
  derivative of the potential energy is the familiar gravitational force
  \begin{align*}
    mg = \frac{GMm}{R^2}.
  \end{align*}
